# Salesforce JWT Configuration Template
# ==========================================
# IMPORTANT: Copy this file to sf_config.py and fill in your actual values
# DO NOT commit sf_config.py to version control! It's gitignored for security.
#
# This file is used by all scripts that connect to Salesforce via JWT authentication.
# Your actual sf_config.py should NEVER be committed to GitHub.
# ==========================================

# Your Salesforce username (email address)
SF_USERNAME = 'your-username@example.com'

# Connected App Consumer Key from Salesforce
# Found in: Setup → App Manager → Your Connected App → View → Consumer Key
SF_CONSUMER_KEY = 'your-consumer-key-here'

# Your Salesforce instance URL (optional, typically auto-detected)
SF_INSTANCE_URL = 'https://your-instance.lightning.force.com'

# Salesforce login domain
# - 'login' for production
# - 'test' for sandbox
SF_DOMAIN = 'login'

# Path to your RSA private key file (.pem)
# This private key must match the certificate uploaded to your Connected App
# Example: '/Users/yourname/Desktop/Salesforce_Reports/salesforce_private_key.pem'
PRIVATE_KEY_FILE = '/path/to/your/salesforce_private_key.pem'

# ==========================================
# JWT Setup Instructions:
# ==========================================
# 1. Create a Connected App in Salesforce:
#    - Setup → App Manager → New Connected App
#    - Enable OAuth Settings
#    - Enable "Use digital signatures"
#    - Upload your public certificate (.crt file)
#    - Note the Consumer Key (use as SF_CONSUMER_KEY above)
#
# 2. Generate RSA key pair:
#    openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
#    openssl req -new -x509 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 365
#    (Use server.key as PRIVATE_KEY_FILE, upload server.crt to Connected App)
#
# 3. Copy this file to sf_config.py and fill in your values
#
# 4. Ensure your private key file is secure and NOT in the repository
